# Collection and maintenance

## July 24, 2017

#### Adapting *Acropora cervicornis* to laboratory conditions

* Corals were obtained from MOTE laboratory from various locations in the Florida Keys
* MOTE provided 6 tagged genotype
	- Yellow (30)
	- Orange (31)
	- Green and Orange (31)
	- Red and  Yellow (31)
	- Green (30)
	- Red and Orange (30)
* corals were added to a tank with other *A. cervicornis* kept at 26-27ºC with two pumps and build my LED light at 100% intensity

----------

## July 25, 2017

#### Epoxy

* Genotypes were epoxied together on clipboards and labelled to prevent the pumps from blowing the fragments into no man’s land

----------

## July 26, 2017

#### Tagging fragments
* Plastic numbered tags + glue + previous epoxy

#### IPAM Time 0
* First IPAM data taken by CD and AP
